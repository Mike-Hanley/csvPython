## Introduction to Python - Capstone Project

##Description

*  This project ingests financial data and utilizes utility

## How To Run

*  Clone the python_captsone project folder to the Desktop.
*  Open the project folder using Intellij.
*  Once opened in Intellij, navigate to the FinancialData.py file.
*  In the upper right hand corner, there is a box next to a start button and build tool
*  Click the box and select edit configuration.
*  Under paths at the top, select the FinancialData.py file.
*  Now when the run button is clicked, the file will run correctly.

*  At the top of the FinancialData.py file, under the DataLoader class,
*  replace the path for the data variable to the correct stocks.csv path
*  located within the python_capstone folder.

*  Next scroll to the bottom of the file.
*  There you will find how to run the converter function which will print
*  results in the console.
*  Additionally the write_file function will allow entering a name, industry, or market
*  parameter. Once the parameter is entered, click the run button at the upper right
*  of the interface and a report.txt file will be generated within the python_capstone folder.
*  Additionally the path can be adjusted in the write_file method to send the report
*  to a specified location.
